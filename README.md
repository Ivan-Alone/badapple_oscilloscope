## Description

Oscilloscope can display graphs using XY mode. This project generates a waveform file that can be used to draw video using the oscilloscope XY mode.

![XY Mode](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/Lissajous_figures_on_oscilloscope_%2890_degrees_phase_shift%29.gif)

(gif was from wikipedia)

If You want to do this, just download wave file from [release](https://github.com/yeonzi/badappe_oscilloscope/releases) page, playing this audio file by any player, the left and right channels are connected to the X and Y channels of the oscilloscope, and you will see the video.

## TODO

1. Change path search algorithm to a faster algorithm.
2. New edge detection algorithm for color frames.
3. Can I read video frame to bitmap using libffmpeg, no need to write to disk?
